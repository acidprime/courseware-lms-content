Welcome to Puppet language basics

This course helps beginners to Puppet become familiar with the basics of writing Puppet code, and it’s the first step towards integrating Puppet into your configuration management workflow.

You will explore a series of micro-lessons, each containing brief interactive exercises designed to give you hands-on practice writing Puppet code. In this course you will learn how to work with resources, attributes, variables, services and facts, packages and package file service. Each lesson increases in difficulty as the course advances, so you won’t be overwhelmed with information from the get-go. If at any time you feel stuck, the How To Use This Course page contains links to a glossary and documentation, as well as links to our thriving Slack community where employees and Puppet-enthusiasts alike are frequently available to step up and lend a hand with any questions you might have. 

Once you finish the course you will receive a badge of accomplishment that shows you have taken your first big step on your journey to learning Puppet.
