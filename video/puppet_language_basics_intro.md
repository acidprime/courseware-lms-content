This course provides an overview of working with the Puppet language, including how to write code that is scalable for an infrastructure of any size. As you progress through the course, put your knowledge into practice by deploying, installing and configuring applications using Puppet on an interactive command-line tool. By the end of the lesson you will have gained hands-on experience writing Puppet code, as well as structuring, locating and implementing the resources you will use going forward with Puppet.
