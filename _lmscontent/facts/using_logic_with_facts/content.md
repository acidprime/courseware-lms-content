## Introduction:
You learned that you can use variables and facts to dynamically set values in your code. The next step is to use variables and facts to make decisions in your code. Here you'll learn to write code that follows logic like <q>If my operating system is Windows, do this. Otherwise, do something else.</q> You can use if/else syntax to do this in your code. Take a look at the following layout:

<div>
<pre><code class="language-none">if $some_fact == 'some_value' {
  $my_variable = 'yes'
}
else {
  $my_variable = 'no'
}</code></pre>
</div>
## Task:
Complete the exercise below. Notice that the $hello_file variable is used in the file resource declaration.
