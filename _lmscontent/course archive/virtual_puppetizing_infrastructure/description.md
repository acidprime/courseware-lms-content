## Prerequisites
#### Students
In this course, we expect students to have little or no experience with Puppet Enterprise (or open source Puppet) and are looking to build a foundation for future growth, experience, and knowledge. The course is designed to benefit DevOps professionals with a basic understanding of the core systems administration problem space.

The labs and exercises draw equally upon examples relevant to supported platforms such as the Windows and Linux/Unix OS families. You will be provided with partial solutions, which you will then complete to arrive at working solutions.

In order to complete the course successfully, you need to have experience equivalent to a junior sys admin. Familiarity with scripting in PowerShell and/or Bash is recommended.

#### Technical
Students will be provided with access to a hosted classroom environment.
