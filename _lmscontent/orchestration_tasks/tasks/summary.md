# Introduction to Puppet Orchestration: Tasks
Puppet Tasks are a way to solve problems that don't fit well into Puppet's traditional declarative configuration management model.

This training has three objectives:

* Understand how to choose between using model-driven configuration management or running a Puppet task
* Learn how to run a task from both the command line and the console
* Install and use tasks in modules
