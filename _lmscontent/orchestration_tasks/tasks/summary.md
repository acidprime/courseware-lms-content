# Introduction to Puppet Orchestration: Tasks
Puppet Tasks are a way to solve problems that don't fit well into Puppet's traditional declarative configuration management model.

This training has three objectives:

* Learn how to run script or task from command line and the console
* Install and use tasks in modules
* Understand how to choose between using configuration management with Puppet or running a task
