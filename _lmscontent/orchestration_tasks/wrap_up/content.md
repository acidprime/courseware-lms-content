### Practice
Now that you know more about Bolt and tasks, visit the [Tasks hands-on lab](https://github.com/puppetlabs/tasks-hands-on-lab)
to practice your skills. This covers the full Bolt ecosystem, the open source task runner
subsystem of Puppet Orchestration that you learned about in the first module. Bolt uses SSH and WinRM as transport
mechanisms, while Puppet Orchestration uses your existing Puppet infrastructure.
For the most part, where the hands-on lab instructs you to run `bolt task`, you
can also run `puppet task` to accomplish the same results. The lab also
covers writing task plans: scripts that can programmatically
aggregate multiple tasks in sequence, or make conditional runtime decisions about them.
