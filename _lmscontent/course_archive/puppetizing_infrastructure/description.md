<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<h4>Students</h4>
<p>In this course, we expect students to have little or no experience with Puppet Enterprise (or open source Puppet) and are looking to build a foundation for future growth, experience, and knowledge. The course is designed to benefit DevOps professionals with a basic understanding of the core systems administration problem space.</p>
<p>The labs and exercises draw equally upon examples relevant to supported platforms such as the Windows and Linux/Unix OS families. You will be provided with partial solutions, which you will then complete to arrive at working solutions.</p>
<p>In order to complete the course successfully, you need to have experience equivalent to a junior sys admin. Familiarity with scripting in PowerShell and/or Bash is recommended.</p>
<h4>Technical</h4>
<p>Students will be provided with access to a hosted classroom environment.</p>
