As you start writing more Puppet code, you will likely find yourself repeating the same values over and over. This is redundant, time consuming, and can lead to spelling errors and bugs in your code.

To save effort and decrease the likelihood of typos, assign those repeating values to **variables**. Variables make it easier to manage those values by letting you update one thing instead of having to update many repeating things. This also ensures consistency throughout your code.

## Task:
Watch the following video to learn how and why you should use variables.
