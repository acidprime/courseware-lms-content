Currently, the file you have been working on in this course is hard-coded to be located at <code>/etc/motd</code>. As you learned, using variables rather than hard-coding information about your file is a better method to write code because it reduces the likelihood of typos and bugs. Try using a variable instead.

> **Protip:** You can use comments in your code by using a hash like this: <code># this is what a comment looks like</code>. Comments help to organize your code and also to communicate with other people who read your code.

Set the `$motd_file` variable to `/etc/motd`.
