## Introduction:
Puppet can see a variety of attributes about a file or any resource type. Some examples of other attributes might include **mode**, **ensure**, **owner**, or **group**. The <code>puppet resource</code> command shows you all the attributes Puppet knows about a resource, as well as their values. This is useful for identifying and examining the contents of any given file.

## Task:
Enter the <code>puppet resource</code> command to see all the attributes of the <code>file</code> at <code>/etc/motd</code>.
