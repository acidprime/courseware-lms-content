Now that you've learned more about Puppet facts, write some Puppet code to create the `robby.cfg` file containing the proper content where *HOSTNAME* should be replaced with the actual name of the server using a fact:

`welcome_msg = Welcome to Robby, running on HOSTNAME!`

## Task:

<p><iframe src="https://magicbox.classroom.puppet.com/scenario/create_robby_cfg" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</p>

You have now configured the service with the required contents in the `robby.cfg`. The next step is to actually start the service after it has been configured, and you will do that in the next section.
