## Welcome!

Understanding Puppet Language Basics is an essential step in putting your Puppet knowledge into practice. The lessons are focused on real-world problems to teach you best practices for working with and writing Puppet code.

Interactive code boxes throughout the course simulate a command line tool and evaluate your code to help you master Puppet syntax. Here's how they work:

* Look for the text inside the code boxes for hints to complete each exercise.
* Like a command line interface, you will get feedback and error messages if you enter invalid syntax or code into the box.
* Unlike a command line interface, this output has been specifically designed for learning purposes and differs from running Puppet on your own system.
* In some cases, you will only be able to select the **Test** button once your code meets certain basic parameters.
