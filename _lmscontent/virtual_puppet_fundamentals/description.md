In this three-day course, students will learn Puppet best practices and use Puppet to write simple classes, and update and extend existing modules. Fundamentals is taught through a combination of lecture and relevant, real world, hands-on exercises.  After completing this course, students will be able to deploy basic system configurations using best practices for Puppet in a Master-Agent setup.

## Prerequisites
#### Students
In this course, we expect students to have little to no experience with Puppet Enterprise (or Puppet Open Source) and are looking to build a  foundation for future growth, experience, and knowledge.

Students should know the command line, such as Bash or PowerShell, and are familiar with operating system concepts such as services, packages and configuration files.  Be familiar with a text editor. The standard workflow uses GitHub's online editor, but you many use any text editor that you are comfortable with.

Students definitely need junior-level sysadmin skills. For example:

* how to restart a service
* what an entry in the hosts file means
* what a hostname is
* how to troubleshoot basic networking problems such as name lookups, DNS lookups, and basic connectivity

Be able to configure a virtual machine (either of VMware or VirtualBox) to use bridged or NAT networking.

If you'd like an opportunity to refresh your Unix skills before logging in, you might work through the following material:

* [Unix tutorial for Beginners](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ "")
* [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/ "")

#### Technical
Please review the technical requirements for your class [here](https://learn.puppet.com/tech-requirements "").

If you prefer to learn from the Windows perspective, you may provide your own VM instead. It should be Windows Server 2012 or greater.
