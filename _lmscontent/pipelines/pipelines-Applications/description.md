+With Puppet Pipelines for Applications, you automate the way you build and deploy traditionally-packaged applications. You can automatically trigger application builds each time code is committed to your source control repository, create continuous integration pipelines within minutes using intuitive visual dashboards, automatically promote releases based on criteria you set, and easily deploy applications to VMs and servers running in any cloud and on-premises. Puppet Pipelines for Applications tracks every event on your applications and makes it simple to take action, giving you full visibility and control over your entire software delivery pipeline.
