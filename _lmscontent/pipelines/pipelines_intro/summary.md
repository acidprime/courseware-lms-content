# Introduction to Puppet Pipelines
Puppet Pipelines simplifies software delivery and unifies automation silos across Dev and Ops teams. Puppet Pipelines is a family of offerings that automates the way you build and deploy your applications and gives you deep visibility and audit trails for every action taken. You get end-to-end continuous delivery and automation for your entire software delivery lifecycle, from the time your developers commit application code to the deployment of those apps to servers, VMs and containers running on any cloud and on-premises.
