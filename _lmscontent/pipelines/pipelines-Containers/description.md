With Puppet Pipelines for Containers, you automate the way you build and deploy container-based applications to Kubernetes. With a few simple steps, you can automatically build Docker images directly each time code is committed to your source control repository, and deploy those containers to Kubernetes clusters running in the cloud or on-premises. Puppet Pipelines for Containers tracks every event on your container-based apps, with intuitive dashboards that enable you to quickly create continuous integration workflows, take action and view audit trails for every build and deployment.
