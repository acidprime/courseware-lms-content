If you&rsquo;d like to work with the provided Training VM and you&rsquo;d like the opportunity to refresh your Unix skills before logging in, you might work through the following material:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/\">Unix tutorial for Beginners</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/\">Command Line Crash Course</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You will also want to be familiar with a text editor. Puppet trainers typically use Vim, but you may use any text editor you are comfortable with. The provided Training VM includes vim, emacs, and nano.</p>\r\n<p>You definitely need junior-level sysadmin skills. For example, you should know:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>how to restart a service</li>\r\n<li>what an entry in the hosts file means</li>\r\n<li>what a hostname is</li>\r\n<li>how to troubleshoot basic networking problems such as name lookups, DNS lookups, and basic connectivity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be able to configure a virtual machine (your choice of VMware or VirtualBox) to use bridged or NAT networking.</p>\r\n<p>Have the <a href=\"http://downloads.puppetlabs.com/training/puppet-student.ova\">Training VM</a> downloaded to your computer before you show up. We will run through the configuration and installation for this VM in class, so you don't need to boot it up prior to class. Just make sure that it's on your computer and you know how to start it.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you prefer to learn from the Windows perspective, you may provide your own VM instead. It should be Windows Server 2012 or greater.</li>\r\n</ul>","price":{"amount":3700.0,"currency":"USD"},"priceMultiplier":1.0,"primaryCategoryId":6,"priority":3,"providerId":1,"purchasableAsEngagement":false,"shared":false,"status":"DISABLED","theyTookThisCourse":"","urlName":"introduction-to-devops-puppet-fundamentals","visibility":"DEPRECATED"}
