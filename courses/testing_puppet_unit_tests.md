# Testing Puppet: Unit Tests

As your codebase grows in complexity, changing one part of the code without affecting other parts becomes exponentially more difficult. Unit tests are a method for ensuring that individual parts of your codebase continue to work as intended while other parts are improved and refactored as needed.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

* Explain the purpose of unit testing.
* Describe methods for using rspec-puppet to test.
* Identify elements of Puppet module unit spec tests.

### slide 1 - Testing Puppet: Unit Tests

As your codebase grows in complexity, changing one part of the code without affecting other parts becomes exponentially more difficult. Unit tests are a method for ensuring that individual parts of your codebase continue to work as intended while other parts are improved and refactored as needed. 

### slide 2 - Testing Flow Diagram

This course is one in a series of courses that we have created to help you learn more about testing Puppet code. Earlier courses included topics focused on why testing is important, how to validate your Puppet code with puppet parser and puppet lint, and how to write basic smoke tests to verify that your code compiles and cleanly applies to a node.  In this course we move towards more rigorous testing of your Puppet code and modules. Unit testing allows you to check whether your code actually behaves in the manner that you expect. And once you have units working individually, you can move on to methods for testing your complete configuration, such an acceptance testing. 

In this course we look at how to write unit tests for your Puppet modules using the rspec testing library. But first - a brief review of the structure of a Puppet module. 

### slide 3 - Module Review

Modules are self-contained bundles of code and data. On disk, a module is a directory tree with a specific, predictable structure. The module name is the outermost directoryâ€™s name. The manifests directory contains all of the manifests in the module, including an `init.pp` manifest where the class name matches the module name. Other manifest file names map to the names of the classes they contain. A well-formed Puppet module implements each class in a separate file in the manifests directory. Although these directories are not mandatory, for the purposes of testing, you should have an examples sub-directory that contains the test examples that you write for smoke testing your class declarations and defined types. And you should have a spec directory where you put spec and server spec tests, including unit tests, that you use to test plugins in the lib directory.

### slide 4 - Why unit tests?

Unit tests let you test parts of a complete configuration, in isolation from one another and in a controlled context, so that you can identify exactly what pieces may be not working and under what conditions.  Your unit tests should be as simple as possible and easy to debug. They should test the smallest unit of functionality and are intended to prove that each part of your code can work on its own as intended and independent of the other pieces.

### slide 5 - What to tests?

Unit tests don't test the results of executing your manifest on a live system. What they do test is the behaviour of Puppet when it compiles your resources into a catalogue. Your unit tests ensure that resources are included and that classes are declared. They also validate the resource attributes and evaluate results with different class parameters.

### slide 6 - How to tests?

Puppet is written in Ruby. And so it works very well to test your Puppet modules with a Ruby tool. In the Ruby world, there are several testing libraries that you can use to test your Puppet modules. rspec is a popular one and one that we use extensively at Puppet Labs. Rspec-Puppet provides a unit-testing framework for Puppet. It extends rspec to allow the testing framework to understand Puppet catalogs, the artifact it specializes in testing. With rspec-puppet, you can write tests to test that aspects of your module work as intended.

### slide 7 - Simple Tests

At first glance, it could appear that writing unit tests is nothing more than duplicating manifests in another language.  And that may be true for simple manifests. 

### slide 8 - Template in the test

However, when you start to write more complex modules, that include dynamic content from templates, support multiple operating systems, or that take different actions when passed parameters, unit tests are invaluable. And when you add new functionality to your modules, unit tests can help protect against regressions when refactoring or upgrading to a new Puppet release.

### slide 9 Test-Driven Development

Test-Driven Development involves writing tests before writing the code that you are going to test. You begin by writing a very small test for code that does not yet exist. You run the test, and of course it fails. Then you write just enough code to make the test pass.  

### slide 9.1 Test-Driven Development

rspec was created in 2005 by Steven Baker from the idea that with languages such as Ruby, he could more freely explore new test driven development frameworks that could encourage focus on behaviour instead of structure.  Although the syntax has changed over time, the basic premise remains the same. You can use rspec to write executable examples of the expected behavior of a small bit of code in a controlled context. You likely already have modules written that you want to test. And for the purposes of this course, we use examples from tests and modules that are already written as well. 

### slide 10 - rspec Matchers

rspec includes a number of useful expression matchers. For the purpose of validating conditions, rspec matchers can match exact values, regular expresssions, or Ruby Procs. Let's look at some matchers and methods for validating some conditions.

### slide 11 - Catalog compiles

First, to test whether a catalog compiles cleanly, you can use the compile matcher. And if you want to see the error messages that are raised, you can use the compile matcher with the method "and raise error" and the error message that you want to see. In this example, we are checking for an error message that indicates that the apache module does not run on Windows.

### slide 12 - Catalog Resources

You'll also want to check that the catalog contains resources that you need. To check whether a resource exists you use the contain matcher, the type, and the resource  title that you want to check for. This example is checking to see whether an s s h service has been declared.

### slide 13 - Specified Resource Attributes

To validate that resources have specified attributes, you use the contain matcher, and add a method,  either with or without, and the attribute with the value you are checking for. You can chain together as many methods as you want, as we have done in this example. We are checking that a service is present, that there is a file with a specific owner, root, and for a file that has the mode attribute undefined.

### slide 14 - Resource relationships

You can also use matchers to validate that resources relationships are set. You can test the relationships between the resources in your catalog regardless of how the relationship is defined. In other words, you can define relationships with the metaparameters require, before, notify, and subscribe, or with chaining arrows. Once again you use the contain matcher and you add a relationship metaparameter, as shown in this example. 

### slide 15 - Matcher Shortcuts

You can also combine matchers. This example shows how you can use chaining to create shortcuts. 

### slide 16 - Puppet Module Generate

Next let's look at a recommended structure for your testing directories. If you use puppet module generate to create your module,  Puppet creates the directories, and the appropriate files in those directories, that you need for testing . 

### Slide 17 - Testing Directory Tree

This is a recommended directory structure and naming conventions for purposes of testing your module. Although none of the sub-directories are required, these are some sample group directories. If you use this structure, your examples will be placed in the correct groups automatically and will have access to the custom matchers. However, if you choose not to use this structure, you can force the examples into the required groups with syntax such as this to test a class.

### slide 18 - Install rspec-puppet

If you used the Puppet module generate to create your module, Puppet automatically created spec directory for you. However, you still need to install the Ruby gems. To install the rspec-puppet gem, type the command `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install rspec-puppet`. Then, to set up tests, install the puppetlabs_spec_helper gem. Type the command `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/bin/gem install puppetlabs_spec_helper`. You may notice that we use Puppet's vendored Ruby, instead of the system Ruby, to install. Although not always the best practice, it happens to be the simplest method of making the proper libraries and gems available for rpsec-puppet to load. You should only install a gem into Puppet's vendored path if that gem needs to work with Puppet in some way. 

### slide 19 - Sandbox files

rspec rspec-puppet needs three files in order to run your tests. If you use Puppet Module Generate to create your module, Puppet creates the Rakefile and the spec_helper file. .fixtures.yml is a file used exclusively by rspec to pull in dependencies required to successfully run unit tests.
 rspec compiles Puppet catalogs in a sandbox. It needs a minimal environment, including a module path. the fixture dot yml file creates the modulepath for the sandbox. You need to create the fixture dot yml file, and include in it  symlinks for all the modules that the module you are testing depends on. 

### slide 20 - Structure of rspec-puppet Tests

So, now that rspec-puppet is installed and we've looked at the basic rspec-puppet concepts, the recommended directory tree structure for testing your modules, and the required files, let's look more specifically at writing rspec-puppet tests. Regardless of whether you are testing classes, defined types, functions, or hosts, the basic structure of your test file is the same. You want to include the spec_helper  library of functions for running your tests. The basic structure of describing the thing you want to test  and what the test should do lets you easily express concepts in a conversational manner.


### slide 21 - Test Naming and Placement

How you name your tests and where you place them is important.  Test files should always end in _spec.rb and the convention is that they are named for the thing that you are testing. In the recommended spec directory structure,there are sub-directories for the different unit tests. Class tests should be placed in spec/classes, defined type tests should go in spec/defines, and so on. 

### slide 22 - spec-puppet Test Example

Let's look at a simple module that includes examples of some of the concepts and topics presented in this course. This simple module is named "ssh" and its purpose is to  install, manage, and start an ssh client and server on Redhat and Debian platforms. 

The ssh spec dot rb file is the test file for the ssh class. Describe tells us what we are testing - the ssh class. Do tells us the steps for the test. For both Redhat and Debian platforms, without any passed parameters and with the provided I P address, validate that the package is installed, that the appropriate configuration file is used - either server or client, and that the service is running.

### slide 23 - Test Passes

To execute the test, from the top level of the module directory tree, run the command rake spec, with the path for Puppet's vendored Ruby. If the test is successful, you receive output that the spec test has a status of green, indicated by the green dot. The system provides the run time, the number of tests run, and the number of failures.

### slide 24 - Test Fails

If the test fails, you receive output similar to what we have in this example. Instead of the green dot, you'll see an upper case lett ef. It is highlighted here in red. The system provides a description of the failures and where they are located in the tests. You can also see a list of the tests that failed.

### slide 25 - Summary

You use unit tests to validate each individual class in your module under controlled conditions. Units tests validate that the catalog compiles and includes all the resources as expected. Once you are confident that your Puppet module does what you expect it to do, independent of the rest of your code base, your are ready for acceptance testing which tests your module when it is executed and which we address in the next course.

### slide 26 - Next Steps

You use unit tests to validate each individual class in your module under controlled conditions. Units tests validate that the catalog compiles and includes all the resources as expected.
 Once you are confident that your Puppet module does what you expect it to do, independent of the rest of your code base, your are ready for acceptance testing which tests your module when it is executed and which we address in the next course.
