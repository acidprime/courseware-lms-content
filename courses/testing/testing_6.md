A comprehensive suite of tests for your Puppet code can offer tremendous peace of mind and free up your team to move more quickly. As your code base becomes more complex, tests become even more important. Although tests take time to write, investing that time now will pay off in a fewer emergencies in the future.

The supported and approved Puppet Forge modules are a great place to look for example code. The `puppetlabs-apache` module has [an extensive set of acceptance tests](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apache/tree/master/spec/acceptance).
