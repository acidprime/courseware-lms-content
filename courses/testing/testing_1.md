## Testing Puppet code

Automated testing is an essential part of creating solid, reliable Puppet code. Developing tests for Puppet code does not need to be a burden, but it can be difficult to know where to start.

## Levels of testing to filter out bugs

Imagine your tests like a series of sieves or filters trying to filter rocks and debris out of a pile of rocky soil. You'd want to start with a cheap sturdy filter to first remove the larges boulders.

Below that, you'd have a finer screen to catch medium sized rocks and branches. After several layers you might have a very delicate fine mesh that would only let the good soil through. 

It might seem like a good idea to just have that final filter, after all it would catch boulders as well as pebbles, but that final stage is also the most expensive, the most delicate, and the slowest. It's best to be close to the finished product when you get to that stage.

With testing Puppet code, you can very quickly catch a large number of bugs with minimal effort. With each layer of testing you'll focus on finer details. Since you've already caught the larger bugs, you don't need to cover such a large area, which is good because the tests become more complicated and slower with each level.

There are few different categories of tests that are relevant to Puppet:

* Syntax and style validation
* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Acceptance tests

In this course, you'll learn about the different kinds of tests, the basics of testing Puppet code, how you can get started with testing, and how testing can enable you to move faster in development with less risk.
