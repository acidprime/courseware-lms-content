# What is Puppet Enterprise?
Puppet Enterprise is IT automation software that gives system administrators the power to easily automate repetitive tasks, quickly deploy critical applications, and proactively manage infrastructure, on-premises or in the cloud.

Puppet Enterprise automates tasks at any stage of the IT infrastructure lifecycle, including: discovery, provisioning, OS & app configuration management, orchestration, and reporting.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

## Transcript

"Meet Joe. He's a system administrator in charge of managing his company's servers. Joe spends a lot of time manually configuring servers, and it's taking weeks to launch new applications. Joe also spends a lot of time fighting fires. And he'd like to spend more time building solutions that don't catch on fire. He wishes that he could automate the things that he already knows how to do, and spend more time learning to solve new problems, like using cloud technologies to better serve his business."

"Joe decides to use Puppet Enterprise because it gives system administrators the power to automate repetitive tasks, consistently provision new systems, quickly deploy critical applications, and proactively manage his infrastructure."

"Puppet Enterprise is an interactive solution that allows Joe to automate an individual pain point, like managing sudoers or NTP configuration. He can see instant results to prove the value, and he can expand his automation footprint to other parts of his infrastructure."

"He can start with the operating system layer, then move up to the network layer, middleware layer, and all the up to the application layer until he has a fully automated infrastructure."

"Joe can now manage his resources by writing it once in Puppet's simple configuration language, which allows him to use it in many different operating systems. It's also portable to different deployment environments including physical and virtual servers, or in the public, private, or hybrid cloud."

"Joe can define the intended state of any node, and Puppet Enterprise will remediate the settings to the desired state whenever there is any deviation. By automating away his menial tasks, Joe now spends less time fire fighting, and can spend more time learning and building. Joe can also get up and running with new technologies a lot faster by using one of over a thousand shared configurations from the Puppet Forge."

"With Puppet Enterprise, Joe is more productive with his time, he can manage more nodes, and solve more problems. His company can now launch new applications within hours or even minutes. Puppet is a widely adopted solution across every major market with over 10 million nodes managed.
