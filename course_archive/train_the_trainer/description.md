The Train the Trainer course provides detailed information on classroom setup, technical specifications, and guidelines for instructors. It is a required step in the onboarding process to teach on Puppet's behalf. This course covers only instructor-led, in-person Puppet Fundamentals and Puppet Practitioner courses.
