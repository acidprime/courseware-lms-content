Use SSH to connect to your instance at:

* ec2-54-68-245-249.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com, or
* 54.68.245.249

Log in using the username and password of <code>root/puppet</code>.

This is a restricted environment that provides only SSH access and no outbound network. It will terminate itself, discarding all data on disk, when you log out. You will not be able to reconnect later and retrieve any data. The shell will also automatically log out after five minutes of inactivity. Please behave and don't abuse the resources we are providing.

You may only have one virtual environment allocated at any given time.
